# Solutions!
### Thatâ€™s what we seek, all the time.
Solutions to go beyond our limitations.
Solutions to live better.

Welcome to my GitHub page, and thanks for visiting!
During all my career, I dedicate myself to identify demands and problems in all instances of processes, and create paths to find and actually reach their solutions.

As a team leader, I acted as a facilitator on finding the path to be taken so that the team could reach its goal.
As a developer, I prioritize understanding the customer's real needs, to create effective solutions for their demands, focusing on the usability and efficiency of the apps we build together.
